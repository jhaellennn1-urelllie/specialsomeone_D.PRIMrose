const message = `Happy birthday, baby.

If you‚Äôre wondering why I‚Äôm awake at this ungodly hour, it‚Äôs because my brain refuses to sleep without making sure I tell you how much I love you first. You‚Äôre probably already dreaming peacefully, and honestly, I‚Äôm a little upset because you forgot to say good night üò≠ but it‚Äôs okay, baby, I understand. I know you‚Äôre tired, and I know I was being extra earlier. I‚Äôm sorry for nagging and for being clingy‚Äîit‚Äôs just my way of showing how much I care about you, even if it‚Äôs chaotic and a little annoying.

I love you, baby. Like, scientifically speaking, my limbic system lights up every time I think about you. My neurons literally fire dopamine and oxytocin whenever your name pops into my brain, and it‚Äôs not even fair because you weren‚Äôt made to be this good at making me feel every emotion at once. You‚Äôre the reason my heart‚Äîyeah, that literal muscle that pumps blood‚Äîis racing right now. And speaking of the heart, remember that argument we had? When I told you it‚Äôs ‚Äújust a muscle, it literally pumps blood‚Äù and you were trying to explain it differently? Baby, I was so extra, but also, secretly, that was the moment I thought, wow‚Ä¶ okay, I might be a little obsessed with you because you‚Äôre actually so smart and patient while I‚Äôm over here being ridiculous. That‚Äôs the thing with you‚Äîyou‚Äôre amazing, and it‚Äôs not even a surprise anymore because you are always amazing.

Baby, I worry about you constantly. I worry if you‚Äôve eaten, if you‚Äôre hydrated, if you‚Äôre sleeping enough, if you‚Äôre overworking yourself. I know you‚Äôre grown and capable, and I shouldn‚Äôt worry so much, but still, love me, I can‚Äôt help it. My love is basically like my own little research project on how much someone can care about another human being, and the data is conclusive: I care about you more than I should, and yes, it‚Äôs perfectly irrational but I‚Äôm embracing it fully.

I hope today is magical for you. I hope the universe conspires to give you peace, freedom, happiness, and all the good things you deserve. I hope the air you breathe feels lighter, the sun feels warmer, and every little thing reminds you that you are loved, baby. You deserve every joy, every success, every hug from your family, every silly moment, and every late-night talk or late-night movie watch we get to share, even if it‚Äôs just through a screen. Those moments, baby, are everything to me. They make me feel close to you, even across all the distance.

I want to say I love you a thousand times, baby, and it still wouldn‚Äôt be enough. I love you in every thought, every neuron, every heartbeat, every sigh, every giggle. I love you when I‚Äôm being clingy, when I‚Äôm being silly, when I‚Äôm overthinking, when I‚Äôm stubborn, when I‚Äôm quiet, when I‚Äôm loud. I love you in every possible way that a human brain and heart can process love. My existence right now basically revolves around loving you, and I wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way.

I pray for you, baby. I pray that God guides you, protects you, and keeps you safe. I pray that He blesses you with health, happiness, peace, and clarity in everything you do. I pray that He surrounds you with people who love you as much as I do, and that He continues to bless your family with love, safety, and joy. I pray that every path you choose is full of success, and that your dreams become reality. I pray that life treats you kindly, even when it‚Äôs hard, and that you always feel supported, loved, and celebrated.

You‚Äôre my person, baby. You‚Äôre the one I want to laugh with, cry with, debate with, and share every little detail of my life with. You make every ordinary moment extraordinary. You make my heart‚Äîyes, that muscle again‚Äîfeel like it‚Äôs performing some high-level, super-efficient love-pumping function just for you. Every late-night talk, every late-night movie watch, every moment we share through texts and calls makes me feel closer to you, even though we‚Äôre far apart. Those moments are my favorite memories, and I look forward to making millions more with you, baby.

I‚Äôm rambling, I know, but that‚Äôs kind of the point. I want this message to feel like me being completely me, baby‚Äîall thoughts, all emotions, all love, all obsession, all science, all heart. I want you to read this and feel everything I feel when I think of you, when I miss you, when I worry about you, when I laugh at you being cute, when I just‚Ä¶ love you endlessly.

So, happy birthday, baby. Thank you for being the one who makes my dopamine levels go wild, who makes me smile at my phone like a fool, who makes me think that love can be this scientific and this emotional at the same time. I love you more than all the words in the English language, more than all the science I can study, more than my brain can quantify, more than my heart can pump. Love me, baby, and let me keep loving you forever, okay?

Happy birthday again, baby. You are amazing. You are loved. You are my favorite human, my heart, my chaos, my calm, my baby. I love you, love mewhwhhehe.`;
